Based on the following project context, generate creative suggestions for additional features, scenarios, and enhancements:

CURRENT USER INPUT:
{current_input}

EXISTING REQUIREMENTS:
{existing_reqs or "No existing requirements found"}

CURRENT FEATURES:
{features or "No features documented yet"}

USE CASES:
{use_cases or "No use cases documented yet"}

TECHNICAL CONTEXT:
{tech_details or "No technical details available"}

Please provide creative suggestions in the following categories:

1. ADDITIONAL FEATURES - New functionality that would complement existing requirements
2. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS - Different ways users might interact with the system
3. INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES - Ways to connect with other systems or services
4. ENHANCEMENT IDEAS - Improvements to existing functionality
5. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS - Features for potential future phases

For each suggestion, provide:
- Category (from above)
- Title (brief, descriptive)
- Description (2-3 sentences)
- Value proposition (why this would be beneficial)
- Implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High)

Format your response as a JSON array of suggestion objects:
[
  {{
    "category": "ADDITIONAL_FEATURES",
    "title": "Feature Title",
    "description": "Detailed description of the feature...",
    "value_proposition": "Why this feature would be valuable...",
    "complexity": "Medium",
    "priority": "High"
  }}
]

Generate 5-8 diverse, creative suggestions that go beyond the obvious requirements.
